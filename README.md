# 🏨 Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis

A data analytics project aimed at identifying factors contributing to hotel reservation cancellations and providing actionable business insights to reduce them. This project uses real-world hotel booking data to explore cancellation patterns, customer behavior, pricing strategies, and country-wise booking trends.

---

## 📌 Objective

To analyze reservation data from City and Resort hotels and:
- Identify key factors leading to reservation cancellations.
- Understand customer behavior based on pricing, booking source, and location.
- Offer strategic suggestions to reduce cancellation rates and increase revenue.

---

## 📊 Business Problem

Both City and Resort Hotels were experiencing high cancellation rates, leading to:
- Revenue loss
- Low room utilization
- Operational inefficiencies

This analysis aims to help hotels improve **pricing**, **promotion**, and **customer targeting** strategies.

---

## 🔍 Key Questions

- What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
- How can cancellation rates be reduced?
- How can this data guide pricing and promotion strategies?

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** `hotel_bookings.csv`
- **Duration Covered:** 2015–2017
- **Key Columns:**

  - Booking channel
  - Country
  - Average daily rate
  - Reservation status
  - Lead time, etc.

---

## 🧠 Hypotheses

- Higher prices lead to more cancellations.
- Longer lead time (wait before check-in) increases cancellation likelihood.
- Most bookings come through **offline travel agents**.

---

## 📈 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV data handling
- EDA techniques and visualization

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- **~37% of reservations** are cancelled—significantly impacting hotel revenue.
- **City hotels** attract more bookings compared to resort hotels.
- **Pricing** plays a strong role—cancellation is higher when average daily rate is high.
